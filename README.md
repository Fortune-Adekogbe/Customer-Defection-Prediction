# Customer-Defection-Prediction
### AI-Saturday-Cohort-5

Customer defection is the loss of clients or customers.
Telephone service companies, ISPs, insurance firms, etc, often use customer defection analysis and
rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less
than acquiring a new one.

Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary defection (churn) and involuntary defection
(churn). Voluntary defection occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company
or service provider, involuntary defection occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation
to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications,
involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate
on voluntary defection, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship
which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is
provided.

Predictive analytics use defection prediction models that predict customer defection by assessing their
propensity of risk to defection. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential
defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the
customer base who are most vulnerable to defection.

My team of machine learning engineers were presented with data from a telco company and tasked to
analyse the data and gain insight into customer defection as-well-as develop a model that will predict
the possibility of defection by any customer. After successful completion of the project, we were
expected to prepare a report detailing our data analysis and information of algorithms used to develop
models for prediction.
